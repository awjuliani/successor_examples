# Successor Representation Examples
Examples of successor representation learning. 

### Requirements

Python 3 and Jupyter notebook. See `requirements.txt` for additiona python package requirements.

## Example Notebooks

* **SR-SARSA** - Jupyter Notebook which walks through example of learning to solve gridworld task with moving reward location. Uses tabular successor representation trained using SARSA algorithm.
